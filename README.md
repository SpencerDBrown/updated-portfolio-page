# updated-portfolio-page

This weeks project entailed updating our previous portfolio page we made. I couldn't find or recieve the README with the acceptance criteria but I asked a few questions about what should be looked for with this assignment. Rather than starting with the original portfolio page I had, I decided to write a new one from scratch but use the same assets and see if I could make something utalizing bootstrap CDN and get more comfortable with it. Overall after this assignment I feel much more confident with the CDN and can construct a webpage relatively fast (at least compared to my first few attempts). Only things I would want to add to the assignment are animations and transitions, thats about it! Overall a fun project!
